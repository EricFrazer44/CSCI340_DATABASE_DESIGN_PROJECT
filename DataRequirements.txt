The database is structured to handle a variety of interconnected processes, such as managing menu items, tracking inventory, processing customer orders, and coordinating deliveries. Each table represents a specific component of the restaurant's operations and is designed to store essential information in a way that maintains accuracy and consistency.

The menu table is one of the most critical parts of the system. It contains details about the restaurant’s offerings, such as item names, categories (e.g., pizza, beverages, salads), and prices. To add flexibility, menu items can have different sizes, which are stored in a related table that links each size to a menu item and its corresponding price. Ingredients are another key component, as each menu item is tied to the ingredients it requires. This many-to-many relationship is managed through a separate table, allowing the system to track how ingredients are used and ensuring inventory is updated appropriately when an order is placed.

The inventory table is essential for managing the restaurant’s stock levels. It includes details like item names, quantities, and the suppliers providing each item. The supplier information is stored in a separate table, which tracks their contact details and allows the inventory to be linked back to specific suppliers. Constraints are used to ensure that inventory levels remain valid and prevent errors like negative quantities.

The orders table connects customers, employees, and menu items to capture the full lifecycle of an order. Each order is linked to a specific customer and the employee processing it, and it includes the total amount and order date. Some orders also have an associated delivery, which is handled through a related table that includes additional details like the delivery address, delivery time, and status. This design ensures that orders and deliveries are tied together, supporting an efficient workflow for the restaurant’s operations.

Separate tables manage information about customers and employees, which supports the flexibility of the system. Customers can place multiple orders, while employees can process many orders. Finally, the system includes a table for managing discounts and promotions, enabling the restaurant to define special offers with details like the percentage discount and the start and end dates of the promotion.

This structure ensures the database reflects the real-world processes of the restaurant. Relationships between entities are clearly defined, and constraints are in place to maintain data integrity. The design not only supports the day-to-day functionality of the restaurant but also enables future flexibility for enhancements or additional features.
